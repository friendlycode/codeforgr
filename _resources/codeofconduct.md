# Code of Conduct

This code may be summed up simply: Be Kind. However, since this does not always happen, we  have elaborated on this principle below.

## What is this?

Friendly Code is an organization about working, as a group, to empower ourselves and others to improve our local community through technology. This code of conduct serves to ensure that everybody and anybody who wishes to participate is able to do so, and applies to all Friendly Code events, from hackathons to happy hours. Friendly Code is committed to providing a safe and welcoming space, without regard to age, gender, race, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, physical appearance, religion, level of technological knowledge, or any other attribute. The captains of Friendly Code ("Captains") share the responsibility of  enforcing these policies as necessary to maintain an open and welcoming environment.

As the organizers of Friendly Code, we believe that the below principles are essential to maintaining this environment. In addition, we believe that they are good principles for life in general.

## Principles

### Do Not Harass

Harassment is any unwelcome or hostile behavior towards another person for any reason. This includes, but is not limited to, intimidation, physical contact, sexual advances (verbal or physical), or other conduct that makes others uncomfortable.

Friendly Code will not tolerate such behavior.

### Respect the Opinions of Others

Friendly Code is designed as a place for people all of different skill levels and approaches to meet and work together toward common goals. As a result, we do not expect that everybody will share the same opinion. However, we do expect that disagreement is done respectfully.

### Keep Your Team Open

Except for instances where it would significantly impede productivity, there is always room on a Friendly Code project for one more person. Unless doing so would be counter-productive to the goals of the project, anybody who is interested in a project is allowed to join it.

## Procedures

### Making a Report

If you are unable to resolve the issue, or are uncomfortable doing so, you should contact a Captain. Captains agree to keep information shared in association with a Code of Conduct violation private, and may reveal it only with the approval of the affected person(s). Contact information for each Captain is listed on the [About page](/about.html), and you can also send an anonymous (or non-anonymous) message through the [Contact page](/contact.html), in which case it will be seen by all Captains.

When making a report, the following information is useful, but not required:

- Who violated the Code of Conduct?
- Where and when did the violation occurred?
- What happened?
- Who may have witnessed the violation?
- Who are you?

### Outcomes

Captains agree to treat all violations impartially. In situations where this may not be possible due to personal or business relationships, Captains shall refer the violation report to another appropriate decision-maker with the approval of the affected person(s).

Captains may take any of the following actions, or any other appropriate action, to resolve a conduct issue:

- Individual Meeting: A meeting between the party responsible for the conduct and Captain(s).
- Group Meeting: A meeting between the parties involved, with Captain mediation.
- Team Realignment: Members may be asked to work on a different project. This action shall not be used as a punitive measure against the affected party.
- Expulsion: In extreme situations, the offending party will be barred from future Friendly Code events.
